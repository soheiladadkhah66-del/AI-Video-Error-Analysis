# Overview

This repository provides a structured analysis of failure modes observed in modern AI video-generation systems.  
It summarizes the core technical limitations, highlights reproducible error patterns, and establishes the foundation for a scenario-driven corrective architecture (not disclosed at this stage).

The purpose of this document is to offer a quick, high-level reference for researchers and engineers before they read the full README.
